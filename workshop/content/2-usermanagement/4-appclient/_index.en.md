## Check Your User Pool's App Client

A Cognito Userpool and a new App client has been created by the AWS Amplify build. Let’s take a look at this app client.

1. Go to the [Amazon Cognito Console][cognito-console]
2. Choose **Manage User Pools**.

    Here you will see a new userpool generated by the AWS Amplify CLI that looks something similar to the example below:
    ![Amplify init screenshot](/images/cognito-userpool-screenshot.png)
3. **Click** the new user pool to open the Pool Details page
4. From the Pool Details page, select **App clients** from the **General settings** section in the left navigation bar.
5. You will see that a new App client has been generated.  Your web application is configured to use this App client via a config file located in `wild-rydes/src/aws-exports.js`.

#### How it Works: 
Rather than configuring each service through a constructor or constants file, Amplify supports configuration through a centralized file called aws-exports.js which defines all the regions and service endpoints to communicate. Whenever you run `amplify push` or rebuild your web application by running a `git commit`, this file is automatically created, allowing you to focus on your application code. The Amplify CLI places this file in the appropriate source directory configured with amplify init.

:heavy_exclamation_mark:  You won't see updates to this file in your local file store because it is included in the _.gitignore_ file.
